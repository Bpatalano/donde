# Sprint: Solo Hackathon
___

### Sprint Overview: A Monday through Tuesday evening event to hack on something cool and possibly bring it forward into the short project.

### Preread: 

Let's take a second to reflect. The majority of you entered Hack Reactor with little coding experience, but as you read this, you have successfully absorbed the vast majority of content you will need to get your first engineering role. Congrats.

Even so, you may not be feeling like an elite engineer yet. Many students struggle with confidence at this point of the course because they didn't crush Nightmare Mode or they just feel light-years away from matching their own ideal. This is totally normal and we want to help.

The solo hackathon is time for you to iterate on these feelings and update them with the present reality of your skills.

That said, there is no right amount of code or features to produce. This should be a fun process of selecting a cool idea and then seeing if you can make some version of it happen.

Likely anti-pattern (fixed mindset):
1. Pick an idea, imagine the end product.
2. Do hackathon
3. Fall short of goal
4. Feel bad becuase you're not yet the engineer you imagined Monday morning.

Proposed pattern (growth oriented):
1. Reflect on how much you've learn until now
2. Pick an ideas becuase the product sounds cool to you or the technology is interesting. 
3. Do what you can in two days
4. Reflect on how badass you've become.

You are on your way to becoming an autonomous and highly effective engineer, we know, because we're been working with you for over 5 weeks now.




##Basic Requirements
[ ] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).

[ ] Write it down on paper

[ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.

[ ] Cut that scope in half.

[ ] Cut the above scope in half

[ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demo's your idea)

[ ] Finish anything




##Extra Credit
[ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 

[ ] Deploy so the whole world can see!

[ ] Use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.

Feature branch workflow - a very simple, very popular method  
Gitflow workflow - more complicated, but useful for larger projects (probably overkill for this project period)  
- there are some other workflows you can choose from as well, but no matter what you choose, I encourage you to have someone other than the person who wrote the code review it before it's merged into the central repository. If all looks good, then the person who wrote the code should be the one to merge it (that way they can make a quick fix in case anything goes wrong).
