# Sprint: Solo Hackathon

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks. 

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.

Budget you time wisely. Remember, if you are particulately succesful, you may have the oppurtunity to carry your product into the short project period.


### Getting Started:

To build on your learning of core engineering concepts, we will beging thinking about how to actually manage projects. Engineering management is a deep skill and discipline with lots of history and academic writing. We will focus on just some highlights of content to give a very brief context of how we arrive here.


* [Waterfall Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) - An important interim development model that stressed a series of phases or stages in which all the tasks of that phase were completed before moving on the next. This is somtimes are a required method when building an expensive, physical object like a plane or building, but is virtually never preferrable for software.

* [Iterative and incremental development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) - Proposed in the 60's by NASA engineers, this was an attempt to reduce the risk of changing requirements during concurrent develoment process. Think of a space shuttle (physical engineering project) that is proceeding with waterfall. As the aerospace engineering team understands the limits and capabilities of the shuttle, the software team has to adapt their features and functionality. 

*  [Agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) - is a modern eveolution of Iterative and Incremental Development (IID) that further formalizes the IID philosophy with a set of principles and best practices. It also applies Lean Manufacturing process like [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).

* [Lean Product Process](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) - Takes the essence of Agile Development methodology and applies it more broadly to the development of product and buiness models that support he requirements of the project. 


## Basic Requirements

- [ ] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
- [ ] Write it down on paper
- [ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
- [ ] Cut that scope in half.
- [ ] Cut the above scope in half
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demo's your idea)

- [ ] Prepare for pitch @ demo on Tuesday


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 
- [ ] Deploy so the whole world can see!
- [ ] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.
