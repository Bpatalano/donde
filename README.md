# Sprint: Solo Hackathon

### Overview:

You have 36 hours to produce something compelling using the skills you've honed over the past five weeks. 

__Q:__ What are your inputs?
<br>
__A:__ 36 hours of (relatively) undivided attention

__Q:__ What is the required output?
<br>
__A:__ A compelling product presentation delivered to your classmates.

Budget you time wisely. Remember, if you are particulately succesful, you may have the oppurtunity to carry your product into the short project period.


### Getting Started:

<SECTION IN PROGRESS ORIGINAL TEXT IN COMMENT>

<!-- 
Let's take a second to reflect. The majority of you entered Hack Reactor with little coding experience, but as you read this, you have successfully absorbed the vast majority of content you will need to get your first engineering role. Congrats.

Even so, you may not be feeling like an elite engineer yet. Many students struggle with confidence at this point of the course because they didn't crush Nightmare Mode or they just feel light-years away from matching their own ideal. This is totally normal and we want to help.

The solo hackathon is time for you to iterate on these feelings and update them with the present reality of your skills.

That said, there is no right amount of code or features to produce. This should be a fun process of selecting a cool idea and then seeing if you can make some version of it happen.

Proposed pattern (growth oriented):

1. Reflect on how much you've learned until now
2. Pick an ideas becuase the product sounds cool to you or the technology is interesting. 
3. Do what you can in two days
4. Reflect on how badass you've become.

Likely anti-pattern (fixed mindset):

1. Pick an idea, imagine the end product.
2. Do hackathon
3. Fall short of goal
4. Feel bad becuase you're not yet the engineer you imagined Monday morning.

You are on your way to becoming an autonomous and highly effective engineer, we know, because we're been working with you for over 5 weeks now.

## Basic Requirements

- [ ] Pick an idea (implement a technology, build a product, make art, etc).
- [ ] Write it down on paper
- [ ] Imagine what portion of this could be done in 24 hours.
- [ ] Cut that scope in half.
- [ ] Cut the above scope in half
- [ ] Use iterative development (go straight to something that demo's your idea)
- [ ] Finish anything


## Extra Credit

- [ ] Storage - if your app persists data, use a tool like Parse or Firebase. 
- [ ] Deploy so the whole world can see!
- [ ] If applicable, use an MVC Framework - Make your app production grade with a full-on MVC.
