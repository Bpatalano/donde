There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  ¿Donde?

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  People introducing themselves that want to be able to show on a map where they are from and give a couple facts about the area they come from.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  ¿Donde? is a query app that returns interesting information about a location typed into a search field. This location can be any real city in the world and the app will return interesting facts about that location such as it's population, climate, demographics, it's nearest coast, what large cities it's near, and how close it is to them. In addition to that it will generate 2 maps, one that shows where in the country the city is located and the other showing a map of the city itself. All of this is displayed in a very concise and glanceable interface that is ideal for quick icebreaking situations, or for learning the gist of where someone is from in a short amount of time.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

This product solves the issue that sometimes arises when people discussing where they are from run into when one person hasn't the slightest idea of the geography of the other person's hometown. Slowly the person trying to describe where they are from moves to more notable, often larger reference cities that are farther and farther from their hometown to manage to get to a point that the other person knows about. This product would skip this conversation and get right to the point by displaying multiple relative locations of each person's hometown and give some interesting facts about the town at the same time to add to the conversation.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This product solves the problem by calling on wolframalpha.com's search engine to find the city and return statistics, demographics, and geographics. It then displays the results in a glanceable format that is perfect for quick querying and sharing between people on one screen. The most obvious alternative to this would be to use a google map search, but this app would be superior because it would only have one, specific result and would simultaneously display some interesting facts about the place you are searching about that would be nice for conversation. Furthermore google map searches return dynamic results that can slow down the rate at which results are returned where this product returns a static result that is formatted for quick searching and sharing to keep the conversation moving. This simple, speed driven search and share format is exactly the point so that it is never quicker to try and describe to a new person where you are from and instead you can just use ¿Donde? and keep the conversation moving.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  '¿Donde? is the quickest way to get to know a room full of new people's origins in an organic conversation.'

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  There are no profiles or sign-ups, so it's as quick and painless as possible. Eventually your top queries will be saved as well, so someone can just bring up their hometown without any typing required.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  'I was so tired of descibing where the "Inland Empire" was in relation to LA, and now with ¿Donde? I can just type in "Riverside" and select USA and CA and I have a map of the whole area and a list of nearby cities and their distances from my city. It's great for meeting new people and seeing where they are from.'

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  '¿Donde? doesn't do anything new or too exciting, but in a globalized world where coworkers, neighbors, or anyone you are meeting for the first time may be from anywhere in the world, it makes showing others exacty where you're from and seeing where they are from quicker and easier than trying to explain yourself by returning just the interesting information and displaying it in a glanceable format. To see this web app in action just head over to ...'
